# Activity 2 - Combining Similar Components

## Goals
- Experiment with ways to combine the similar card components

### Catch Up
To catch up to this point in the workshop, run:
`git checkout activity_01`

## Summary
Managing two large components that have similar responsibilities and stylings is just extra maintenance.  It would be ideal if these two could be a single-card with the flexibility to show either desserts or kittens.

## Steps
- Make a common card from the two cards
    1. Create a new component using the angular cli `ng g c common-card `
    2. Combine the Kitten and Dessert cards into common-card
