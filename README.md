# reusable-angular
In this workshop, we will explore ideas around building Angular applications that are scalable and easy to work in. We will talk about what makes a component reusable. We will build a visual component with in an app that utilizes redux using NgRx to connect to an api. We will move the component into the library of an existing monorepo and then use it in second app.
